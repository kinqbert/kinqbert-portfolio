# Portfolio website

Welcome! This is my first Next.js application that also serves as my portfolio website. It is a simple website that showcases my skills, projects and provides a way to contact me.

Website is live and can be found [here](https://kinqbert.dev/).

Design was made by me and implemented using Next.js, TypeScript, SCSS and Vite.
